# Car Price Predictor Project

## Overview

Car Price Predictor is a sophisticated machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of used cars with utmost accuracy. The project utilizes a robust linear regression model trained on a meticulously curated dataset obtained from Quikr, a reputable online marketplace for pre-owned vehicles.

## Dataset and Data Quality

The dataset, "quikr_car.csv," is a comprehensive collection of used car listings featuring key attributes such as car make, model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, and the corresponding price. Our team has taken meticulous efforts to ensure data quality by addressing non-linear values, converting relevant columns to appropriate data types, and handling missing values effectively.

## Machine Learning Model

The heart of this project lies in a state-of-the-art linear regression model, meticulously crafted to accurately predict car prices based on the provided features. The model undergoes rigorous training and evaluation to ensure optimal performance and generalization on unseen data.

## Usage and Deployment

To deploy the Car Price Predictor, simply follow the instructions provided in the "car_price_predictor.ipynb" notebook. The well-documented code includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps, ensuring ease of use and seamless integration.
